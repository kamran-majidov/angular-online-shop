# Online Shop Project

Welcome to our Online Shop Project. This project is a demonstration of the Angular framework, showcasing its capabilities in creating dynamic web applications.

## Features

- **API Integration**: We use the Platzi Fake Store API to fetch product categories and other data. Please note that the data from this public API can change at any time.
- **Authentication**: For login and registration, we utilize local storage. This method is used for demonstration purposes to illustrate how Angular can handle user authentication and data management.
- **Explore**: Check out our amazing products or discover various categories.
- **Enhanced User Features**: After registering, you'll be able to add products to your cart, favorite items, edit/add/remove products as well as categories. Registered users can also proceed to checkout and enter their details for the order.
